A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.
All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.
As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again.
Badges? We ain't got no badges! We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinking badges!
Bond. James Bond.
E.T. phone home.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night.
Forget it, Jake, it's Chinatown.
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!
Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty ape.
Go ahead, make my day.
Hello, gorgeous.
Here's looking at you, kid.
I am big! It's the pictures that got small.
I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
I'll be back.
I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.
I'm walking here! I'm walking here!
La-dee-da, la-dee-da.
Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make.

One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.
Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By.'
Rosebud.
I am serious…and don't call me Shirley.
Say “hello” to my little friend!
Show me the money!
The stuff that dreams are made of.
There's no crying in baseball!
There's no place like home.
They call me Mister Tibbs!
Today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!
What we've got here is failure to communicate.
Why don't you come up sometime and see me?
You can't handle the truth!
You don't understand! I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I could've been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.
You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.
You talking to me?
You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya, punk?
