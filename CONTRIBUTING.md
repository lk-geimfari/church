## Guidelines

- Add one change per one commit.

- Always comment your code (only in English!).

- Check your spelling and grammar.

- Check code with [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) or with any other similar tool.

- Run the tests after each commit.

- Make sure the tests pass.

- If you add any functionality, then you should add tests for it.

- Do not write bad code!

- Use `data/locale_template` if you want to add new locale.
