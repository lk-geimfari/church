- Added annotations for all methods and functions for supporting type hints
- Added new data provider `Payment`
- Added new methods to `Payment`: `credit_card_network`, `bitcoin_addres` (previously `bitcoin`), `credit_card_owner`

**Fixed**:
- Fixed issue with `primes` in `Numbers` data provider
- Fixed issue with repeated output on using `Code().custom code`
- Other minor fix and improvements

- Removed non informative custom exception `WrongArgument` and replaced one with `KeyError` and `NonEnumerableError`
- Parameter `category` of method `hashtags` is deprecated and was removed
